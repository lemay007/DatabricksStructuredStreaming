In addition, we're doing a _stateful_ aggregation: one that requires Structured Streaming to maintain and aggregate data over time.\n\nWhen doing a stateful aggregation, Structured Streaming must maintain an in-memory _state map_ for each window within each partition. For fault tolerance reasons, the state map has to be saved after a partition is processed, and it needs to be saved somewhere fault-tolerant. To meet those requirements, the Streaming API saves the maps to a distributed store. On some clusters, that will be HDFS.
